This course provides a practical, project-based, hands-on exploration of the state-of-the-art techniques and software frameworks from machine learning and deep learning for solving real-world problems from biomedicine, biotech, and related fields. 

Recent years have seen a surge of interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence. This is caused by highly-visible breakthroughs in a variety of areas like computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition and synthesis, and in the analysis of unstructured, tabular data. As many of the challenges faced in more general domains are transferable to specialized domains, we have seen a torrent of scientific publications and new applications across all data-driven fields, from medicine to physics, biology to cosmology. The course provides a practical, project-based, hands-on exploration of the state-of-the-art techniques and software frameworks from machine learning and deep learning for solving real-world problems from biomedicine, biotech, and related fields. It will be a guided tour of a useful, interesting, and important landscape, pointing out theoretical and application-oriented gold-mines along the way.
